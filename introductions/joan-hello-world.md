# Hello World!

## About You

**What do you want to be called?** 

My name is Joan, so let's stick with that. :)

**What is one of your proudest accomplishments or favorite memories?** 

A favorite memory of mine is walking happily along a dusty dirt road on the Camino de Santiago, in the sun, just me and my backpack.

## About You and The Course

**What do you hope to get from the course?** i.e. what are specific things that you want to learn or accomplish by June 05, 2024?

I would like to finish all five modules of TE-Fundamentals. So far, I have passed the first two exams, and I am well on my way with module 3 and 4, so my main focus during the Study Season will be module 5.

I hope to use this course to deepen my understanding of social choice as a corner of the broader field of government. In particular, I would like to explore the potentials and limitations of (different kinds of) voting.

**What do you hope to give to the course?** i.e. what are specific things that you could do to support the instructors and students (while also supporting your own goals)?

I have a cross-disciplinary background spanning general humanistics, foreign language learning, computer science and psychotherapy. My main offer may be experience juggling concepts and ways of thinking coming from diverse fields.

On a more practical level, I may be able to help out if people who are new to programming Python get stuck on this.

I also have a secret passion for exploring limits, finding flaws and breaking things, so I am generally very happy to volunteer as a (friendly and constructive) tester.
